## 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-time streaming data platform for a Smart City environment.  
It collects, processes, and visualizes IoT sensor data in real-time to support analytics and decision-making.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Streaming & Big Data:** Apache Kafka, Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- **Cloud:** AWS (S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift)  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Visualization:** Power BI

## 📌 Features
- Real-time processing of 5 IoT sensor streams using Kafka and Spark.  
- Containerized deployment for scalable and isolated processing clusters.  
- Data ingestion into AWS S3 for raw data storage.  
- ETL orchestration using AWS Glue.  
- Querying processed data with AWS Athena.  
- Loading clean data into Redshift for analytics.  
- Interactive dashboards built in Power BI for monitoring and insights.
